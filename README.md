# California Housing Regression

### Tools/Libraries Used: Jupyter Notebook, Scikit-Learn, MatplotLib, Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn

A combination of these tools and a Kaggle provided dataset allowed me to create a regression model that helps predict the median housing value of a certian area in California. (Further details are outlined within the notebook)
